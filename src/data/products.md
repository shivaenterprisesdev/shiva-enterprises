Double loop coupling" can refer to different concepts depending on the field of application. Could you clarify what context you're referring to? Here are some possibilities:

Mechanical Engineering – In mechanical systems, double loop coupling can refer to a type of flexible coupling used to connect two rotating shafts, allowing for misalignment compensation and vibration damping.

Systems Thinking – In organizational learning and cybernetics, double-loop learning (coined by Chris Argyris) involves questioning underlying assumptions rather than just correcting errors within existing frameworks.

:Programmable Logic Controller

-Delta’s third generation DVP PLCs ES3 series employs the AS series PLC’s 32-bit high-speed processor, provides a user-friendly programming interface, 4 high-speed counter inputs, and up to 4-axis control outputs (pulse). The ES3 series supports 8-axis (CANopen) position outputs (ES3 only) and EtherCAT (ES3-TEC only). Features also include multiple communication ports with robust network functions that enhance integration and connections. Compared with the previous generation, the ES3 series offers a larger capacity, faster execution speed, and enhanced interoperability.

-To fulfill the market demand for versatile, value-added programmable logic controllers, Delta’s third generation DVP PLCs EX3 series employs the AS series PLC’s 32-bit high-speed processor with a user-friendly programming interface, built-in analog I/O, and multiple communication ports. Compared with the previous generation, the EX3 series upgrades execution performance, expands program capacity, and enhances interoperability.

-ES2 series is a small PLC for basic sequential control. It is economical, highly efficient and functional.

-EC3 series is the most economical solution for sequential control and communication monitoring and can operate independently, allowing the user to achieve stand-alone monitor, e.g. monitoring phototransistor coupler, proximity switch, optical sensor, indicator and illumination switch. Through serial ports, EC3 is able to connect to control devices such as PLC, frequency inverter and temperature controller, which can be said to be a programmable application solution that is cost-friendly and highly reliable.

-The DVP-EC5 Series fulfills the market demand for advanced PLCs with a user-friendly programming interface, faster execution of high-speed pulse input/output, and expanded program capacity. The upgrade from the previous EC-3 aligns with demands for a versatile programmable logic controller.
